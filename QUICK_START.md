# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Progressive Hints System

## ✅ What's New

Your screen reading system now has:
- ✅ **Progressive hints** (one at a time, not all at once)
- ✅ **4 personality modes** (Mentor, Sarcastic, Fun, Grade-Level)
- ✅ **"Need Another Hint?" button** for user-controlled disclosure
- ✅ **No more crashes** (fixed EIO write errors)
- ✅ **Beautiful UI** with color-coded hint levels

## 🎯 Start in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Start RAG Service
```bash
cd /Users/tintuk/calhacks/CalHacks/rag-service
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```
✅ **Wait for**: `🚀 Starting RAG Hint Service on port 5001`

### Step 2: Start Desktop App
```bash
cd /Users/tintuk/calhacks/CalHacks/socraticcode-desktop
npm start
```

### Step 3: Use It!
1. **Select personality**: Mentor / Sarcastic / Fun / Grade-Level
2. **Click**: "Start Monitoring"
3. **Open**: VS Code, Cursor, or visit leetcode.com
4. **Wait**: 5-10 seconds
5. **See hints**: In the sidebar on the right!

## 🎭 What Each Personality Does

| Personality | Style | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| 👨‍🏫 **Mentor** | Patient, encouraging | "What data structure helps track elements?" |
| 😏 **Sarcastic** | Witty, clever | "Brute force? If you have all day..." |
| 🎉 **Fun** | Energetic, emojis | "🚀 Hash maps are AWESOME! ⚡" |
| 🎓 **Grade-Level** | Academic, rigorous | "Consider O(n) amortized complexity..." |

## 💡 How Hints Work

### You'll See:

1. **Topic Header** appears first:
   ```
   🎯 Topic: ARRAYS
   Problem related to arrays
   ```

2. **Hint Level 1** (Subtle) shows automatically:
   ```
   👨‍🏫 Hint Level 1
   What approach comes to mind first?
   ```

3. **"Need Another Hint?" button** appears

4. **Click button** → Hint Level 2 (Moderate) reveals

5. **Click again** → Hint Level 3 (Direct guidance)

6. **Completion message**:
   ```
   ✨ You've seen all the hints!
   Try solving it yourself now. You got this! 💪
   ```

## 🎨 Visual Guide

### Hint Levels are Color-Coded:
- **Blue border**: Level 1 (subtle, general approach)
- **Orange border**: Level 2 (specific techniques)
- **Green border**: Level 3 (direct suggestions, no code)

## 🧪 Quick Test

Run this to verify everything works:
```bash
cd /Users/tintuk/calhacks/CalHacks
./test-personality-hints.sh
```

## 🔍 How to Know It's Working

### Terminal (RAG Service) shows:
```
📚 Generating hints for topic: arrays
👤 Personality: sarcastic, Level: 1
🤖 Generating hint level 1...
🤖 Generating hint level 2...
🤖 Generating hint level 3...
```

### Terminal (Desktop App) shows:
```
📷 Capturing screen...
✅ Screenshot captured, analyzing...
🎯 Coding content detected! Topic: arrays
```

### Sidebar (On Screen) shows:
- Topic header
- First hint automatically
- "Need Another Hint?" button
- Progressive hints as you click

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No hints appearing"
- Check RAG service is running: `curl http://localhost:5001/health`
- Make sure you clicked "Start Monitoring"
- Open a coding tool (VS Code, LeetCode)
- Wait 5-10 seconds for detection

### "App crashes on startup"
- This is fixed! The EIO write error issue is resolved
- If it still happens, check console logs

### "Hints don't match personality"
- Make sure you selected personality BEFORE starting monitoring
- Try stopping and restarting monitoring
